# 🎯 PROG7313 – Programming 3C / Open Source Coding

## 📖 Overview

Welcome to **PROG7313 – Programming 3C**! 🚀
This repository contains structured content for the module, including:

* 🚀 Lecture resources which will be updated as we go
* 📝 Activities and Coding exercises
* 📚 Information about the module

This module focuses on native Android app development using Kotlin, with a strong emphasis on hands-on, open-source coding.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder corresponds to a module topic. Inside, you'll find activities and resources that I will add as we go. 📁

## 😎 What’s the reason for this module in BCAD?
By now, you’ve already been exposed to object-oriented programming using Java and/or C# for desktop and web applications. PROG7313 is where we explore open-source coding and mobile development:
* 📱 Build native Android apps using Kotlin
* 🧩 Apply OOP concepts in a mobile environment
* 🗄 Work with local databases (RoomDB) and JSON
* ☁️ Integrate Firebase for authentication, databases, and file storage
* 🌍 Write open-source, version-controlled code suitable for a portfolio

## 🏆 How will the module be taught?
* 🎓 The focus is on preparing you for real software development, not just passing assessments.
* 💡 You will write code, break things, debug, and fix them — this is how real learning happens.
* 📱 Every learning unit results in a working Android application.
* 🧠 Industry context and best practices will be continuously emphasised.

If you engage consistently, you’ll leave this module with apps you can confidently demonstrate.

## 💻 Tools & Tech Stack
For this module, we will use:
* 🧑‍💻 Android Studio (latest version)
* 🧩 Kotlin
* 🌱 Git & GitHub
* 🗄 RoomDB
* ☁️ Firebase (Authentication, Database, Storage)

## 🛠 How does ICE work?
ICE is simple and practical:

My ICE are simple, submit any four apps we built in class. At some point, I will give you GitHub Classroom links to claim repos which you will push to.

❌ No submission, empty repo, wrong language, or blank submission = 0.
