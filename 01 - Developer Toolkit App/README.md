# Activity 1 – Developer Toolkit App

## 📝 Objective
Your task is to build a Developer Toolkit Android application using Android Studio and Kotlin. This activity will help you understand the Android ecosystem, basic app structure, and how developers use tools to improve their productivity.

By completing this activity, you will gain hands-on experience with Android Studio, GitHub, and structuring a useful mobile application.

## 💡 Activity Description
You need to build a Developer Toolkit App that developers can use to store information and resources they find useful while learning or working.

The app should focus on functionality and structure, not visual perfection (for now).

Your app must allow developers to:
* View basic device information
* Store developer notes
* Save useful development links and categorise them

This app will form the foundation for more advanced features later in the module.

> Note:
> At this stage, you do not need a database or Firebase. Temporary or in-memory storage is acceptable, as long as the app works correctly.

## 📋 Functional Requirements

### Device Information
Display basic device information such as:
* Android version
* SDK level
* Device model

### Developer Notes
Allow developers to:
* Add short notes
* View saved notes
* Delete saved notes

### Developer Links Manager
Allow developers to save useful links they find online. Each saved link must include:
* A title
* A URL
* A category

Your app must support at least three categories, for example:
* Documentation
* Tutorials
* Tools
* GitHub Repositories
* Q&A / Stack Overflow

Categories may be predefined or selected by the user. Allow editing or deleting links

## 📚 Resources to Read Before You Start
Before starting the activity, make sure you understand the following:
* 📜 Android Studio Overview – developer.android.com
* 📱 Android App Structure – official Android documentation
* 🧑‍💻 Kotlin Basics – kotlinlang.org
* 🌱 Git vs GitHub – GitHub Docs

## ✅ Minimum Requirements
To be considered complete, your app must:
* Launch without crashing
* Display device information correctly
* Allow adding and viewing developer links
* Categorise links clearly
* Be pushed to GitHub Classroom with meaningful commits

## 🚀 Optional Enhancements
If you finish early, you may:
* Open saved links in the device browser
* Improve UI layout

## 🧠 **Reflection**
Be prepared to explain:
* What part of this app was the most challenging
* Why categorising information is important in real applications
* How this app could grow into a full developer productivity tool

Good luck!
